# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Advent of Code is an [advent calendar of small programming puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/) for each day in December. I'm storing this years solutions here for fun and holiday cheer. 🎅🏻

## Prerequisites 🧰

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system.

## Project Structure 📂

```bash
advent-of-code-2024/
├── 01/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.js
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

Each day's folder contains:

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input provided by Advent of Code
- `solution.js`: The JavaScript solution for both parts of the day's puzzle
- `README.md`: Detailed description of the day's puzzle and any additional notes

## How to run 🚀

Each day is a folder with the day number. To run the solution for a given day, navigate to the day's folder and run the following command:

```bash
node <day>/solution.js
```
